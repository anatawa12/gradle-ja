        <title>Usage</title>
        <para>To use the build announcements plugin, include in your build script:</para>
        <sample id="useAnnouncePlugin" dir="announce" title="Using the announce plugin">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="use-plugin"/>
        </sample>
        <para>That's it. If you want to tweak where the announcements go, you can configure the <link linkend="announce_plugin">announce plugin</link> to
            change the local announcer.
