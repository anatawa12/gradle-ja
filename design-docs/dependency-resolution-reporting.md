Improved dependency resolution reporting

# Use cases.

1. Priority use case: It is hard to figure out why Gradle picks up version X of certain dependency because the dependency report
    only includes the version information *after* conflicts have been resolved.
2. User diagnoses dependency resolve failures
    (with a possible implementation being that the reporting is robust in the face of failures)
3. User views actual class paths
    (e.g currently the reports only show module dependencies.
    It should show external dependencies, self-resolving dependencies, tweaks to sourceSets.main.compileClasspath, etc).
4. User knows why certain dependencies appear / not appear in the graph (e.g. consider exclusions)

# User visible changes

1. The dependencies report should include information of the 'asked' dependency version
Instead of raw version we can print something like: 1.0->3.0. Mock up:

<pre>
testCompile - Classpath for compiling the test sources.
+--- root:a:1.0
|    \--- foo:bar:1.0 - >3.0
\--- root:b:1.0
     \--- foo:bar:3.0(*)
</pre>

We should also remove the confusing configurations from the view.

2. A brand new report that traverses the graph the opposite way.

Mock up:
<pre>
com.linkedin.util:util-core - selected version does not exist in the dependency graph.

com.linkedin.util:util-core:4.0.7
\--- com.linkedin.sharedlibs:configuration-repository-impl:1.3.30
     \--- com.linkedin.sharedlibs:lispring-lispring-core:1.3.30
          \--- com.linkedin.container:container-http-impl:3.0.24
               \--- com.linkedin.container:container-rpc-impl:3.0.24

com.linkedin.util:util-core:2.4.6 -> 4.0.7
\--- com.linkedin.cfg2:cfg:2.8.0
     \--- com.linkedin.sharedlibs:lispring-lispring-core:1.3.30
          \--- com.linkedin.container:container-http-impl:3.0.24
               \--- com.linkedin.container:container-rpc-impl:3.0.24
</pre>

The idea is to traverse the graph the other way and print the dependent path for a given dependency.
This report is useful to track where the given version of some dependency was picked up from in case of conflict resolution.
This drives some conveniences to our DependencyGraph API.
There should be some simple way to run the report from the command line.
While doing that consider adding support for selecting configuration for the regular 'dependencies' report from command line.

# Integration test coverage

1. Scenarios:

* conflicting direct dependencies
* conflicting direct & transitive dependency
* conflicting transitive dependencies
* conflicts with more than 2 candidates
* conflicts in multi-project build
* conflicts with dynamic versions
* conflicts resolved in multiple phases, e.g:

    root->foo:1.0 -> 3.0
    root->foo:2.0 -> 2.5
    root->bar:1.5

* include maven snapshots

* avoid regression of current features:
    * subtree is omitted (*)
    * the configurations are shown

# Implementation approach

1. There are 3 goals:
    1. deliver the functionality to solve the use case
    2. model the dependency graph better so that we can provide a 'lower level' API, (unopinionated toolkit stuff)
    3. leave the codebase in a better state than it was
        (kinda obvious, but wanted to point out that we should end up with better internal model, some clean-up with legacy ivy impl, etc.)
2. Be cautious with DependencyGraphBuilder - it's most complex and it is the heart of resolution.
3. We should not incur increased memory usage - try to serialize the dependency graph and make it available on demand.
    Make sure it does not make things slower.

## Potential approaches to ResolvedDependency

1. We're not changing ResolvedDependency, instead we pass some kind of listener to the the dependency graph builder.
     This listener can receive information about the dependencies and potentially build a proper graph.
     If not listener provided then we graph builder works as usual
2. Make the ResolvedDependency graph work based on the new model. This will require some kind of an adapter.

# Open issues / ideas

1. Model the unresolved dependencies - how to carry the resolution failure?
2. Later, we'd add some conveniences to ResolvedConfiguration to do some traversal of this graph in interesting ways - find me all the module versions, find me all the artefacts, find me all the files, find me all the unresolved dependencies, and so on.
3. I would also think about wrapping access to the graph in some kind of action
